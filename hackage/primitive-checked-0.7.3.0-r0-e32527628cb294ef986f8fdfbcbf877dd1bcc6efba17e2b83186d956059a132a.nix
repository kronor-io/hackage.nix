It adds bounds-checking\nto all functions in @primitive@ that are able to cause segfaults.\nIt is not recommended to use this library in production. However,\nif you are testing a library or application you wrote that uses\n@primitive@, you can temporarily replace your @primitive@ dependency\nwith @primitive-checked@, and your segfaults will become normal\nHaskell exceptions that you can hunt down with GHC's stack trace\nfacilities.\n\nThe versioning for this library matches the version of @primitive@\nthat is targeted. The first three numbers of the version match the\nversion of @primitive@. The fourth number is used for bug fixes.\nThis packages deviates slightly from the PVP in that functions\ncan be added to the API with only a bump to the fourth number.";
